# Sorcerer's Storm
A Unity 2D card game started as part of a game design course at the University of Utah.  

Class: EAE 2100 Summer 2022 Intro to Game Design  
Instructor: Ashley Guajardo

## Demo

Video - coming Soon

## Purpose
This class focused on the iterative creation of a game design document and then implementation as a paper or digital prototype. 
Throughout the semester we discussed creative excersizes, ideation, game design, narrative, pitching, playtesting, design diaries and post mortems.

The expectations for a digital game were the following:
- single player
- a gameplay loop of at least 2 minutes
- include a win/fail state

## Game Design Steps
1. Choose a verb and illustrate it with a core mechanic. The verb I chose was "lose" with the mechanic being that every choice has a cost.
2. Identify a satisfying win condition. My win/loss condition was to break the curse without losing all of your health, items, and team members. 
3. Identify rules, obstacles and challenges. The rules included selecting a team of four characters, draw encounters and roll for them, and a game timer starting with 10 turns. When you reach an obstacle (locks, enemies, traps, skill checks), then you would choose a character to attempt to overcome it. The challenges at this point included unlocking, fighting, or meeting skill requirements.
4. Bring in a narrative and adjust scope. My narrative was that a sorcerer has brought a storm to the village and you must select four to take on the journey to stop him. There are a limited number of turns to do this. Each obstacle you draw has a stat type that you then roll for that stat with the selected character. The game ends when you defeat the sorcerer or he defeats your team.
